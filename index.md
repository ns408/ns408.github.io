About section

Apart from being awesome, I practice/evangelise DevOps, Agile, Lean, Cloud, Metrics, Containerisation, Twelve-Factor App principles.

So now, buzzwords are out of the way - what do I do:

I work in a Delivery Engineering team which looks after 9 squads. These squads are sort of complete biz units - have their own Product Manager, BA, Developers, Testers and Sales people. I (along with my team) work with them to ask questions such as:
  • what and why do you wanna build something - what's the opportunity or problem that you see
  • is there an easier (cheaper in terms of time and effort) way to test what you're trying to do
  • who are your consumers/customers and what third party services would you consume
  • what is your timeline like
     etc......

I also work passionately on making sure that our Developers are honorary Ops:
  • they involve us since the start of a project
  • they are our primaries on-call for outages and we train and support them with it
  • they collaborate with us on documentation and workflow/processes and aligning their sprint timeline/outcome with ours.
  • they re-use existing patterns for deploying things - which helps us test those patterns and documentation
  • running brown bags, training sessions for them

Now for those who've really read it this far:
  • I do a lot of heavy lifting on architecting things in AWS space. Heavy usage of Cloudformation, EC2, AWS Lambda, S3, RDS. Yes, I can write a JSON/YAML cloudformation template in my sleep. But I'm not too proud about it - I'm proud about the fact that I understand that **Underlying technology can and always will change in a matter of time but principles, learning and understanding that timeline along with the context will keep me ahead of the curve **
  • I also use Ansible heavily at work and we have a framework based on it for deploying all our apps in AWS.
  • Heavy user of NewRelic, Splunk, Pagerduty, Akamai and I'm sure to be forgetting a few other tech thingies.

What do I (*We*) do:
I am part of an amazing squad which is part of a much larger Systems tribe. We work with product squads and provide them consultancy and capability by utilising DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration, Infrastructure as code and related practices.
We don't just deliver the work, rather we focus on assisting the squads become self sufficient through the means of consultancy, tools and frameworks.
We develop and maintain an array of tools and frameworks to help alleviate challenges that projects face during different phases of their lifecycle.
Examples would include:
* Tools for setting up and utilising AWS Services ( VPCs, Cloudformation stacks), Puppet, Bamboo build plans, Splunk, SumoLogic etc
* Our internal agreed set of principles that we use while communicating with our counterpart squads in Systems tribe and other project specific squads.

We lay emphasis on being customer focused and therefore are actively involved in project kickoffs, project increment planning, iteration planning, stand-up and as needed basis for retrospectives for the project squads that we assist.
Our values are aligned with Australia Post values and we enable the project teams bring Australia Post closer to fulfilling it’s benevolent purpose.
