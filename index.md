I build system engineering teams
that provide platform and consultancy services
enabling the software engineering teams to deliver value faster and reliably.

Having started my career as a Linux Systems Engineer, I have a strong background in linux systems, networking, monitoring, virtualisation (xen, kvm, openvz) and automation.

During the last decade, I have spent time honing skills and building solutions around:

- Linux, Open-source
- Cloud Computing (AWS primarily), Data Centers
- IaaS: AWS EC2, Digital Ocean, Linode
- PaaS: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku
- SaaS: Azure Pipelines
- FaaS (Serverless): AWS Lambda
- Continuous Integration / Delivery (CI/CD) - bamboo, buildkite, travis-ci, jenkins
- Automation and configuration management: bash, python, ansible, puppet
- Container ecosystem: docker, docker-compose, kubernetes
- Compliance: infrastructure engineering in ISM and PCI environments.

I am an avid learner and practitioner of principles, methodologies and practices provided by the DevOps movement, Agile and Lean.

My work and learning heavily hinges upon:
leadership, management, business continuity, asset life cycle management, disaster recovery, incident management, reliability engineering, platform engineering.

Strengths:

- Strong Desire for growth and relevance by adding value.
- Ultra Resilience (yes, I can and have worked through chaos)
- Ability to take feedback and act (selectively but swiftly) on it.
- I care.
- Understanding of my weaknesses and biases.
